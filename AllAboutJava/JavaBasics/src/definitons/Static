-If a value of variable is not varied from obj to obj, we can declare such variables using STATIC modifier
-Static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly
-We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes
-Static Data is stored in STATIC POOL  
-Why is the Java main method static? 
-It is because the object is not required to call a static method. 
If it were a non-static method, JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory
allocation.
-Can we execute a program without main() method?
-No, one of the ways was the static block, but it was possible till JDK 1.6. 
Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible to execute a Java class without the main method. Error: Main method not found in class A3, 
please define the main method as:public static void main(String[] args) or a JavaFX application class must extend 
javafx.application.Application
