HashMap always have a bucket of 16 nodes or 0-15 you can say. If no node is added to the Parent node then it is 
called as HashMap once 2 or more nodes added to the Parent Node it becomes Linked List and to the max of 8 nodes 
if added to the LinkedList then it is converted to Balanced Binary Tree.

Balanced Binary Tree is - On the LHS smaller values are stored and on the RHS greater values are stored
And the ThreshHold of adding a node to the Parent node is 8. After JDK-8 it's mentioned once you reach the 
threshHold of 8. Then your linkedList converted to a Balanced Binary tree as it's performance is much better.
And it's complexity is O(log n) as compared to Java 1.8 version in LinkedList O(n)

Collision - When at the same index more than 2 values get stored it is collision in HashMap
How to handle Collision - By creating different nodes attached with the parentNode which we called by creating LinkedList.

How to calculate index in HashMap ? - On the basis of HashCode index gets calculated

As we know in case of Hash Collision entry objects are stored as a Node in LinkedList & .equals() is used to 
to compare HashCode with Key and if it got the correct matching of both then it'll print the defined Value

At first, index got calculated now program will goto the defined index and check on the basis of hashCode & key with the 
help of .equals(). 

Many objects can have same hashCodes, so it'll check for hashCode which user asking & matches the
one which is defined in the object but key does not matches so it'll check next object till it gets same HashCode
& Key for that particular index or until and this way Hashmap converted to Linked List 

IMP******** HashCode & Index of Null key is always null means 0. Ex- marks.put(null,700); // It'll return null
Also we can have only 1 null in the HashMap for that particular HashCode. Another node can be added if we get 
other node with different HashCode means you've already 700 value at 0th index now you entered 
marks.put(null,800), it'll not give you error. It'll simply update the value to 800. And you entered the 
marks.put(null,900) same for 0th index again but this time hashCode is different now it'll create one more node
marks.put(null,800)->marks.put(null,900)
