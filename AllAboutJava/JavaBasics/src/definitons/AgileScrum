- AGILE - Agile methodology is a project management approach that prioritizes continuous improvement. 
It divides projects into smaller phases and guides teams through cycles of planning, execution, and evaluation.

Scrum in Agile - Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal. 
It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient project delivery. Much like a sports team 
practicing for a big match, Scrum practices allow teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to
change. Software teams use Scrum to solve complex problems cost effectively and sustainably.

- What are Scrum artifacts ?

- Product Backlog - list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that must be completed for project
success. It is essentially the teamâ€™s to-do list, which is constantly revisited and reprioritized to adapt to
market changes. The product owner maintains and updates the list, removing irrelevant items or adding new 
requests from customers.

- Sprint Backlog - The Sprint Backlog is the list of items to be completed by the development team in the current
Sprint cycle. Before each Sprint, the team chooses which items it will work on from the Product Backlog.
