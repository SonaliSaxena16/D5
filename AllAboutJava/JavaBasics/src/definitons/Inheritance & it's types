Inheritance - When a class acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent class.
It's of 5 types.
It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

Why we shud use it -
For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
For Code Reusability.

Types of it -
Three types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel and hierarchical.Multiple also a type but not in use now
& Hybrid is also a type which we can say Interface these days 

Note: Multiple & Hybrid are also a type & are not supported in Java through class.

Single inheritance - When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.
Dog class inherits the Animal class, so there is the single inheritance.

Multilevel inheritance -When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance.
BabyDog class inherits the Dog class which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.
By creating Babydog's obj we can access all the methods of Babydog, dog & animal class

Hierarchial - Multiple child classes inherits from single parent class like A is a parent for B C D. Animal parent class Dog Cat Cow child cls

Multiple - When 2 parents class have 1 single child class which inherits properties from both A & B. It's highly discarded

Hybrid - Its a combo of more than 1 inheritance. Ex - singleInheritance+multiple or multiple+hierarchial etc...
For ex - Class A is Automobile Class B is Vehicle Class C is Car and Class D is BMW.
Now it's a combination of Multilevel as - A is the Parent of B, B is the Parent of C and C is the Parent of D
also there' a Single Inheritance if Class D BMW inherits Class C.

Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java ?
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes 
have the same method eat() and we call eat()it from child class B class object, there will be ambiguity, complier wud be 
confused as whose eat() it needs to call bcz B class inherits from A & B as well
Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes
