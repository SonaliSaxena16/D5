We use Extends keyword to implement IS-A relationship.
We can use all the Methods of Parent class in child class.
Ex - Base class where we directly call it to our TestClass expecting that now we would be able to access all the methods defined in
BaseClass. 

If we want to call particular methods not all of the parent class in child class. The we can use HAS-A.
We can implement this relation by creating object with NEW keyword.
Now we shud be able to access all those particular methods which we want as per our requirement. 
Ex- class A has 100 methods now we want some of them in class B. In order to access those we've to create an obj of 
Class A and access only m1() & m70() method
