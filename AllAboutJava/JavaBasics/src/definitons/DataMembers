-DataMembers are the nothing but VARIABLE or Containers which are used to store the value. Ex - a=10, b=20, c=a+b
-Data members may be private or public,but are usually held private so that values may only be changed at the discretion of the class
-Data member are of two types --> Variable Data Member & Constant Data Member
Variable Data Member(whose value can be changed, updated or modified)

Ex - display()
int a=10;
sopln(a);
a=20;
sopln(a); // Output is - 20 now Value updated.

-Constant Data Member(value can't be changed, updated or modified)
-To make Data Member Constant we use FINAL keyword. In case if FINAL Data Member is not initialised then it can only be
initialised once

Ex - final int a=10;
sopln(a);
a=20; // Compile time error
sopln(20);  Compile time error

-Member Function - Are the methods which we write in order to do some operation on those var(Data Members).Ex - with 
the Data Members (a,b,c) we are going to have sum function(). So sum() is the Member Function.
