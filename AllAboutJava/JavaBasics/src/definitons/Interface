-Interface is achieving 1005 Abstraction
-We need to write keyword ex - public interface Car
-As it's 100% abstraction, all the methods defined here are by default abstract means without body & param only name
-As methods are by default Abstract no need to specify keyword Abstract in method
-Child class Bmw needs to implement the interface Car & must provide implementation to every method defined in Car
-Object can't be created for Interface
-We can define only Static, Final variable. Also no need to write final by default it's final in nature
-If you've initialized int wheel = 4, now child cls can't update the vaule
-When to use Interface, when you want to completely hide ur functionality/bussiness logic. Now BMW is a child class 
implemets Car interface. Now nobody will come to know abt the implemetation of the start() stop() & restart()

public interface car{

		public void start();
		public void stop();
		public void refuel();

}

-Note, now it's the child class responsibility to give implementation to all of the above metioned abstract methods
