							ARRAY
						
Array is used to store similar data types (homogeneous) value in an array variable 
Array are of 2 types - 1D & 2D					
1 dimensional array
 - I can store multiple values of similar data types in a single ARRAY variable
 - Size is fixed, that's why it is called STATIC ARRAY.
 
 To overcome FIXED SIZE shortfalls, we use COLLECTION Framework which has - ArrayList, HashMap etc
 
Stores similar data types, to overcome this shortfalls, we use OBJECT ARRAY
In one word, to overcome above mentioned shortfalls, we use Dynamic Array

If the length of the array is n, then the highest index wud be n-1 as it starts from 0 index
Lowest bound/index =0 & Highest bound/index =n-1(whereas 'n' represents the size of the array)
Length always starts with the number 1. And the Array index will always start with the number 0.

 length keyword - Use to represent the size of array of primitive data type.
		    //length always start with number 1.
		    // you can use .length to find the size of an array and size() to find the size of ArrayList
		    //Array index will always start with number 0.
		    // length(); - use to represent number of character present in the string object.length() is final method.
		       

			COLLECTION v/s ARRAY

1 Array is used to store similar data types (homogeneous) value in an array variable, however in collection we can store hetrogeneous types of 
Objects.

2 It reduces programming effort. As it provides built-in methods and classes

3 Optimized & high performance 	

					COMMON EXCEPTIONS WE FACE IN COLLECTIONS
					
NullPointerException
ClassCastException
IllegalArgumentException
IllegalStateException
UnsupportedOperationExceptiom


						COMMON METHODS
						
add()
addAll()											
remove()
removeAll()
size()
clear()
contains()
containsAll()
retain()
retainAll()
		
We can categorise collection (ex- ArrayList, Stack, Vector, HashTable etc) as per these 6 aspects - 
Ordering
Random Access
Key Value
Duplicate Element
Null Element
Thread Safe
