Why Map isn't a Part of Collection Framework ?
Map interface is a part of Java Collection Framework, but it doesn't inherit Collection Interface.
Because Map has - Keys, values, key-value pairs, entrySet, ketSet and Col Interface
doesn't have this Key-Value concept as it has simple methods like add(object) etc.  
So the reason was it was incompatible with Collection Framework and not possible
to have these 2 different concepts in the same Hierarchy. Hence it was build in 
a separate Hierarchy.
