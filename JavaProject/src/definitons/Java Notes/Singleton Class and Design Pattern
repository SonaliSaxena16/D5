Singleton Class - A class which has only 1 or single OBJECT(Instance)can be created 
in the heap memory. And provides a single point of access to that object.

-There shud be no other way to create the Object(Instance)of that class.

- TRICK TO DO THAT-
1 As we know Constructors are called to create the Class Object, what if we make that
Constructor Private. 
2 Then we won't be able to create Object with private constructor.

3 Steps to make singleton class, however there's no such keyword in Java but a CONCEPT

1. Create a static obj 
2. Declare a private Constructor
3. Declare a public static with return type(classname) with methodname, namely getObject() which wud 
return the object of the class every time it is being called.
