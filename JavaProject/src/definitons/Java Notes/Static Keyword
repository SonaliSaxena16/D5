-If a value of variable is not varied from obj to obj, we can declare such variables using STATIC modifier
-Static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly
-We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes
- Static VARIALES & METHODS are not part of the object but are the part of the class.
Ex- class Student{
	int rollNo;
	String stuName;
	static String collegeName = "IGNOU";
	
	public void displayInfo(){
	sysout("name" + name + "rollNo" + rollNo + "collegeName" + collegeName);
	} }
	
	class Test{	//in STATIC POOL obj created with var collegeName, now evry heap memory object like obj1 and obj2 and so on wud simply refer to this POOL agn nd agn no matter how many Objects gets created in HEAP MEMORY
		psvm(){
		
		Student obj1 = new Student(10, "Sonali");	//		in heap memory obj created with var rollNo , name
		obj1.displayInfo();						


Student obj2 = new Student(11, "Sakshi");			//		in heap memory obj created with var rollNo , name
		obj2.displayInfo();


-Static Data is stored in STATIC POOL  
- Static Variables and Methods can be called directly with ClassName no need to create obj as these are part of the cls not obj
- Inside Static Method we can only use Static data members.
- Only Nested class can be STATIC not the Primary class bcz it's not allowed in Java.
-Why is the Java main method static? 
-It is because the object is not required to call a static method. 
If it were a non-static method, JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory
allocation.
-Can we execute a program without main() method?
-No, one of the ways was the static block, but it was possible till JDK 1.6. 
Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible to execute a Java class without the main method. Error: Main method not found in class A3, 
please define the main method as:public static void main(String[] args) or a JavaFX application class must extend 
javafx.application.Application
