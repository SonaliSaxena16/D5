Why we use Getters & Setters in Java

Getter and setter in java are used to achieve encapsulation and data hiding. 

It is because if you remember we've used one of the OOPs concept i.e. Encapsulation where we've defined
objects as WebElement private element;

Now in order to access those private elements we use getters & setters. Getters to get the value and then setters in order to set the value which we've got using getters.

class GetSet {
 
    // Member variable of this class
    private String name;
 
    // Method 1 - Getter
    public String getName() { return name; }
 
    // Method 2 - Setter
    public void setName(String N)
    {
 
        // This keyword refers to current instance itself
        this.name = N;
    }
}


class GFG {
 
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Creating an object of class 1 in main() method
        GetSet obj = new GetSet();
 
        // Setting the name by calling setter method
        obj.setName("Geeks for Geeks");
        // Getting the name by calling getter method
        System.out.println(obj.getName());
    }
}
