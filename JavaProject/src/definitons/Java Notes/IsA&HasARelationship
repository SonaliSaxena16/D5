IS-A relationship - Used in INHERITANCE hence called as INHERITANCE-RELATIONSHIP when one class EXTENDS another class. So using of 
EXTENDS KEYWORD shows IS-A relationship.

Ex - Base class where we directly call it to our TestClass expecting that now we would be able to access all the methods defined in
BaseClass.

HAS-A relationship - It is called as OBJECT/INSTANCE-RELATIONSHIP. When we create 2 different classes and 
wanted to call methods of class1 in class2. It can be achieved by creating object of class1 in class2. 

Ex - class1 {
		public void display(){ }
	}
	
	class2 {
		public void show(){ }
		
		psvm(String[] args){
		
		class1 obj = new class1();
		obj.display(); // This line shows HAS-A relationship 
		} }
