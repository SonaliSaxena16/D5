It's a one time activity static gets load 1 time only when class gets load as static is a part of class not object

1 Identify static members (Static Var, Methods, Blocks). Here if data types are defined then they wud be carrying thr default value ex- if int x=10 I've given but at this step it's value is 0
2 Very 1st static blok will be executed from Top to bottom and assignment of user-defined values to static variables. Here it wud accept int i=10;
3 At last Main() executes
