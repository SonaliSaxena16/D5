Que - What are Cursors in Java ?
Ans - If we want to get Objects one by One from the Collection then we should go for Cursors.

1 Enumeration - uses .elements()
- Applicable only for Legacy classes in Collection Framework ex- Vector & Stack. hence not a universal cursor.
- We can perform only Read operation not remove.
- To overcome above shorfalls, Iterator introduced.
- It has 2 Methods - 
public boolean hasMoreElements()and public Object nextElement()
- ex - Enumeration e = v.elements() // v is for any Vector obj

2 Iterator - uses .iterator()
- Can be applied on any type of Collection hence universal cursor
- We can perform only Read & Remove operation.
- ex - Iterator itr = c.iterator(); // c is any Collection object.
- It has 3 Methods -
public boolean hasNext()and public Object next()and public void remove()

3 ListIterator - uses .listIterator()
- It's the child Interface of list Iterator.
- Moves Bi-directional Forward & Backward both.
- Has Read, Remove, Addition & Replacement of existing objects
- ex - ListIterator ls = l.listIterator()
- It has 9 Methods
3 methods for forward 
public boolean hasNext()and public Object next() and public int nextIndex()

3 methods for backward
public boolean hasPrevious()and public Object previous() and public int previousIndex()

Remaining 3 methods
public void remove()
public void set(Object new) - To replace existing Objects
public void add(Object new) - To add new Objects
