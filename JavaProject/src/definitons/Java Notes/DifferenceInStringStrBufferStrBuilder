Que - Prove How Strings are immutable in Java ?
Do u mean if String s = "10"; & in next line I wont be able to update  the value ?
As s = "20" ? Is that so ?

Ans - No it doesn't meant that. By Strings are immutable means wecan update the value as 10 to 20 30 40
or so on but every time we are passing the new value. It wud chk in String Constant Pool if val
is value else every time it wud create a neew String Obj with the new values passed/assigned.
