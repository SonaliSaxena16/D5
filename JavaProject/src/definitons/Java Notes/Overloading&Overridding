Overloading - 
 Method Overloading is same Method name but different Parameter
 Method resolution is taken care by based on reference type.
 It's also called Late and Static Binding
 Ex- I've used Overloading in Selenium - Action Class, Implicit Wait, Assert
 
 Overridding
 
 	 Polymorphism - One type of Data used in Many Forms
	 Method resolution is taken care by JVM IN CASE OF OVERLOADING based on RUNTIME OBJECT.
	 It's also called Early and Dynamic Binding
	
	Method Overridding is Methods with same signature(which means same method name with same parameters) are
	created in Parent & child class but implementation comes from different class

	Just like in life, Children can inherit properties from Parent, however Parent can't inherit from 
	childern. Same is the case for Parent and Child classes

	In the Test class, we can create Obj of the Parent class(Car) as well as Child class(BMW). 
	
	Overridding is an example of HAS-A Relationship of Inheritance
	
	Using child class Obj we can call Methods of child as well as Parent class. 
	
 However using Parent class Obj one can call only Parent class method not child class. Bcz Parent's can't  
 have Child's prorpeties, whereas child can inherit properties from Parents.
	
 In Test class if Parent class wants to call common method b/w Parent and Child class, then child class
 Obj can be called by Parent Class Reference var. Ex- Car c=new BMW();
 However still Parent class won't be able to call exclusive method of child class like Car class obj 
 can't call BMWs refuel();
	
 This is also called UPCASTING -> Typecasting a Child Obj to a Parent Obj
	
	-------------Till here it's called Upcasting/RUN-TIME/Early BINDING/DYNAMIC Polymorphism--------------------------
	
 Ex- I've used Overridding in Selenium findElement/findElements, get(), navigateTo()
