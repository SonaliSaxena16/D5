We can have multiple Catch Block for 1 Try Block
There can be Try without Catch but Vice Versa is not possible
There is no limit on the number of Catch Block corresponding to Try Block
We can have 1 try block followed with n number of Catch blocks but the program would focus on the 1st
catch block captured.
