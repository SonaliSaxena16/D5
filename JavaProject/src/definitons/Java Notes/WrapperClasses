what are Wrapper Classes ?
A wrapper class in Java is a class whose object contains or surrounds primitive data types.
Primitive data types can be stored in a field created when an object to a wrapper class is 
created. In other words, we can create a wrapper class object out of a primitive value.

Note** Primitives always starts with small letter Wrapper class as Class name always starts with Capital Letter.
