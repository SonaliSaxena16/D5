						HashSet Uses HashMap Internally
						
You can check it out google - hashset java api - goto docJar link 

- It's true that HashSet Uses HashMap Internally 
- HashSet<> hs = new HashMap<>();
- Though Map works on Key, Value pair but in HashSet we don't have any key
- But in set we do hs.add("Sonali"); internally it's taking Sonali as a Key and a Constant which is 
  PRESENT 
- So it takes hs.add("Sonali",PRESENT(null)); where there are 2 keys Sonali and PRESENT and value = null;
