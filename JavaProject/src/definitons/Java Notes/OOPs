OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
5 MAIN OOPs - AIIEP (Abstraction, Interface,Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism). 

A class can also be defined as a blueprint(plan) from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. 
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology 

OOPs have some basic concepts - 
Object - Real world entity
Class - Is a blueprint/roadmap of the objects(how the obj shud behave wt are the color type properties obj wud hold)
Inheritance - When one Class acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent Class 
Polymorphism - Ability to be presented in more than pe form. If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. Ex - Find area, it can be of circle, triangle etc
Abstraction - Hiding internal details and showing functionality only
Encapsulation - Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit. Ex-Java Bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here. Class Ex- Capsule we don't konw what's wrapped inside it

Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language

1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier
2) OOPs provides data hiding
3) OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively.
4) OOPs provides reusability of code
