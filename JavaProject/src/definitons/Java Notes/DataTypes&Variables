-Variables can be termed as a Container i.e. used to store the value ex int a =10; a is variable here.

Variable are of 3 types - Instance/Class/Global , Static & Local

We can define VARIABLES on the basis of their - Access Scope & Creation

Instance var - whn var value will vary from 1 to another var then we will use instance var.
it can be accessed by creating obj
scope will be on obj level 

ststic - whn var value will not vary and it's fixed then we will use Static var
accessed directly or with class.var
scope will be cls level

local - created inside method
scope within particular method
can access thru obj creation
value needs to be initialized

-A DataType is the type of container that what type of value we going to store ex - int string etc 
-If we are expecting DataType int and we've passed String, then it would give InputMismatchException 

-DataTypes are of two types -->
-Primitive --> These are Pre-defined by java. Byte1 Short2 int4 long8 float4 double8 boolean2 char1

When a variable is declared but not initialized, it is assigned a default value based on its data type. 

Object	null
byte: 0 - 1
short: 0 - 2
int: 0 - 4
long: 0L - 8
float: 0.0f - 4
double: 0.0d - 8
boolean: false - 2
char: ‘\u0000’ (null character) - 1
 

-Non Primitive --> These are user-defined in terms of size or length aren't fixed by 
Java. However size or length are fixed for Primitives ex int ranging from 2147483648 to 2147483647. NonPrimitives are - class, enum, interface, String.
NonPrimitives can be declared directly with new Keyword.
Ex if(new String("Tony")== new String ("Tony")){
}
