Que What is API and WebService ?
Ans Application Programming Interface is API, when these APIs are hosted on Web are called WebServices.
All Webservices are APIs but not all APIs are Webservices.

Que Types of WebServices ?
Ans 2 types of it :
SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocal
REST - Representational State Transfer

Que Difference in SOAP and REST ?
Ans SOAP 
Is old to use. 
It sends and receives data only in xml format. Hence low in performance as XML is not light weighted.
Supports only POST Request.

REST 
Trending technology.
We can send request in any format and get the response also in HTML, JSON, Text, XML format. 
REST are fast in nature in order to process requests as they carry light-weighted data like HTML, JSON, Text,
XML. 
REST supports different Operations/Requests to send data to server like Get, Put, Post, Patch, Delete etc

Que Some common HTTP Requests/Verbs ?
Ans Get - To retrieve some data from server
	Post - To create a new data on server
	Put -  To update a data on server
	Delete - To delete a resource/data on server
	
Que What is uri (Uniform Resource Identifer) and it's parts ?
Ans URI - https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2. All it's parts collectively makes a URI 
though Query Parameter may or may not be present but Domain and Path Parameter are a must to make URI
Domain -  https://reqres.in
Path Parameter - /api/users
Query Parameters - page=2

Que What is URL (Uniform Resource Locator)?
Ans It is more of a generi term, what we are sending to perform operation is URL. Ex- Url can be 
https://reqres.in or https://reqres.in/api/users or https://reqres.in/api/

Que Can we send an API request on Browser ?
Ans Yes paste the api in borwser search bar and hit enter it'll return the response in JSON but we cannot do
validations here for that we need to have a API Testing tool like Postman or Swagger.

Que What is Request Payload/Request Body and Response Payload ?
Ans Whenever we send POST(to create) or PUT(to update) we send Request Payload/Request Body to the server 
telling them that this needs to be created or updated.
After sending either POST or PUT body what we receive in response is called Response Payload.

Que Difference in Query Parameter and Path Parameter ?
Ans  Query Parameter will filter the data. Ex- https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2. Here filter is page number=2.
Path Parameter will get the data from the server based on the path we've specified in URI. Ex-
https://reqres.in/api/users here after domain we use / to indicate Path Parameter that these are the 
locations server needs to be redirected.
