Below are the differences between FindBy and findElement in Selenium WebDriver:

FindBy is an annotation while findElement and findElements are methods. Remember FindBy is provided by Selenium not by TestNG. I saw some people have commented such differences.
FindBy is used to support PageObject pattern through PageFactory while findElement is normal way of locating a web element.
If we do not initialise page objects using PageFactory, @FindBy will throw NullPointerException which is not the case with findElement() or findElements() methods.
FindBy will look for the element only when it is used while findElement will look for an element as soon as you call it.
FindBy supports lazy initialization while findElement() and findElements does not.
FindBy can be used to locate one or all using a locator but you need to use findElement to locate one element and findElements to locate all elements using a locator.
You need to explicitly keep track of browser driver instance in FindBy annotated page elements i.e. using PageFactory class to initialize page elements while you call findElement() or findElements() directly on browser driver instance.
FindBy helps to handle StaleElementException as it looks for element every time when it is called. If you use findElement() or findElements() method and store the web element, it will not be relocated again until you do it explicitly.
FindBy supports PageObject pattern which helps you in designing neat tests. So Using FindBy is more preferable than findElement() Methods.
