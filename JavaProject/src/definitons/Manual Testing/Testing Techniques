Testing Techniques - 

ECP - we can use to validate OTP by creating equal no. of classes in input set of test data 
ex - Invalid	Invalid		Valid		Valid
	digits>=7	digits<=5	digits=6	digits=6
	1234567		12345		112233		123456
	
	
BVA - Here we take the values from input set of test data which are on extreme edge or boundary.
Ex - 

Boundary Value Analysis is better than Equivalence Partitioning as it considers both positive
and negative values along with maximum and minimum value.
