It's a Dynamic Wait menas if you have defined 20 sec and driver instance has found the web element in 2 sec
then it'll move to the other action and would not wait for rest 18 seconds.

Though thread.sleep(5000); is a static wait

Also Implicitly Wait and PageLoadTimeout is GLOBAL WAIT - 

Bcz wherever your driver is interacting these waits would be applied automatically once you've mentioned them
in your framework in testBase Class 

So suppose driver is interacting with 50 web Elements it's automatically applied for all of them to wait as per the 
timeunit in seconds you've defined. 

You need not to write pageload or implicitly wait for 50 times.

That's why we mentioned them in our TestBase class and extends this to every other class so it's applied for all 
WebElements
