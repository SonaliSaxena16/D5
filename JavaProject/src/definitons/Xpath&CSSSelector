DifferenceXpath&CSSSelector

1 Xpath allows bidirectional flow which means the traversal can be both ways from parent to child and child to parent as well. Css allows only one directional flow which means the traversal is from parent to child only.

2 Xpath is slower in terms of performance and speed. Css has better performance and speed than xpath.

3 Xpath allows identification with the help of visible text appearing on screen with the help of text() function. Css does not have this feature.

4 Customized css can be created directly with the help of attributes id and class. For id, the css expression is represented by # followed by the id [ #<<id expression>>. For class, the css expression is represented by . followed by the class [.<<class expression>>]. Xpath does not have any feature like this.

5 Xpath expression is represented by [//tagname[@attribute = 'value']. The css expression is repression is represented by [tagname[attribute = 'value'].

6 There are two types of xpath â€“ absolute and relative. But css has no such types.
