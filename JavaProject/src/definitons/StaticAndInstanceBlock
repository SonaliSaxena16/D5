Static Block will execute first even b4 Main()
We can have n number of Static Blocks
It can be written anywhere in the program but will be executed in the sequence as they were written. So output wud be Static Block 1,2,3,4
Que - If there's a static Block and static() which will execute first. 
So 1st wud be blok then method
Que - If there's a static Block and Static() and in Main() we're calling static() which will execute first. 
So 1st wud be blok then any statement if written in Main() then static()
Que - How can we run a program without creating a object
If in the same class calling the method directly, in other class calling it with classname
Que - How can we create object of 1 class in another class, if we make the constructor private ?
Either with static block or with static()
Que - Is it possible to run & compile a Java Program without writting Main() ?
Yes if those have static block, static() and static variable.
Que - Can we initialize Non-Static Variable with Static Block ?
Yes for that create obj of the class inside Static Block and with obj ref call the var within Static Block
Static Variables declared at class level can be directly initialized inside static block.

NOTE - Always 1st static block wud be executed then Main() then instance blok the csonstructor
