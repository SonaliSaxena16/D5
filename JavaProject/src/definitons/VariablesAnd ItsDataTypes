-Variables can be termed as a Container i.e. used to store the value ex int a =10; a is variable here.

Variable are of 3 types - Instance/Class/Global , Static & Local

We can define VARIABLES on the basis of their - Access Scope & Creation

Instance var - whn var value will vary from 1 to another var then we will use instance var.
it can be accessed by creating obj
scope will be on obj level 

ststic - whn var value will not vary and it's fixed then we will use Static var
accessed directly or with class.var
scope will be cls level

local - created inside method
scope within particular method
can access thru obj creation
value need to initialized

-A DataType is the type of container that what type of value we going to store ex - int string etc 
-If we are expecting DataType int and we've passed String, then it would give InputMismatchException 

-DataTypes are of two types -->
-Primitive --> These are Pre-defined by java. Byte1 Short2 int4 long8 float4 double8 boolean char2
-Non Primitive --> These are user-defined. class, enum, interface, String
