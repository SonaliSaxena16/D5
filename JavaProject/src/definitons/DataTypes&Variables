-Variables can be termed as a Container i.e. used to store the value ex int a =10; a is variable here.

Variable are of 3 types - Instance/Class/Global , Static & Local

We can define VARIABLES on the basis of their - Access Scope & Creation

Instance var - whn var value will vary from 1 to another var then we will use instance var.
it can be accessed by creating obj
scope will be on obj level 

ststic - whn var value will not vary and it's fixed then we will use Static var
accessed directly or with class.var
scope will be cls level

local - created inside method
scope within particular method
can access thru obj creation
value need to initialized

-A DataType is the type of container that what type of value we going to store ex - int string etc 
-If we are expecting DataType int and we've passed String, then it would give InputMismatchException 

-DataTypes are of two types -->
-Primitive --> These are Pre-defined by java. Byte1 Short2 int4 long8 float4 double8 boolean1 char2

When a variable is declared but not initialized, it is assigned a default value based on its data type. 

Object	null
byte: 0
short: 0
int: 0
long: 0L
float: 0.0f
double: 0.0d
char: ‘\u0000’ (null character)
boolean: false

-Non Primitive --> These are user-defined in terms of size or length as these parameters aren't fixed by 
Java unlike these are fixed for Primitives. NonPrimitives are - class, enum, interface, String.
NonPrimitives can be declared directly with new Keyword.
Ex if(new String("Tony")== new String ("Tony")){
}
