Singleton Class - A class which has only 1 or single OBJECT(Instance)can be created 
in the heap memory. And provides a single point of access to that object.

-There shud be no other way to create the Object(Instance)of that class.

- TRICK TO DO THAT-
1 As we know Constructors are called to create the Class Object, what if we make that
Constructor Private. 
2 Then we won't be able to create Object with private constructor.

3 Steps to make singleton class, however there's no such keyword in Java but a CONCEPT

a Declare a Variable(Pvt Static instance). 
b Declare a Pvt Constructor
c Declare a public static method, namely getInstance() (is the method we use as it return a 
Signature object) which'll return the singleTon object/instance created in Point(a)
as it is wrapped inside a IFstatement 

Ex - 

public class Employee{

private static Employee instance; // Variable

private Employee(){  // Pvt Constructor
}

public static Employee getInstance(){

if(instance==null){
instance = new Employee();
}
}
