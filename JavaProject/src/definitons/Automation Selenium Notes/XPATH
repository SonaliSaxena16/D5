What is an XPATH ?
Xpath allows bidirectional flow which means the traversal can be both ways from parent to child and
child to parent as well. And is used to locate different WebElements within the XML/HTML Document.

What is the difference between "/" and "//" in XPath

Single slash is used to create Xpath with an ABSOLUTE path i.e. the XPath would be created to 
start selection from the start node.

/html/body/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/a

Double slash is used to create Xpath with RELATIVE path i.e. the XPath would be created to start
selection from anywhere within the document

//div[class="qa-logo"]/a

8 Types of XPATH Axes are there -
Descendant - descendant and descendant-or-self (Mere bachche)
Ancestor - ancestor and ancestor-or-self (Dadaji/poorvaj)
Sibling - preceding-sibling(Mere piche-backward) and following--sibling(Mere aage wle-forward)
child - child
