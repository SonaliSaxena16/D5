A StaleElementReferenceException in Selenium occurs when a referenced web element is no longer attached
to the DOM. This can happen when the element is removed from the page, the page is refreshed, 
or the element is destroyed and recreated. 

How to handle it ?
1. Use Explicit Wait i.e. WebDriverWait with different conditions -  
Method 1 : Wait until the element is present -
 wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(Web element locator")))

Use the try-catch block - The element which is suspected to throw the StaleElementReferenceException
should be kept under try block and in catch block the web page should be refreshed and the element 
should be recreated again.
