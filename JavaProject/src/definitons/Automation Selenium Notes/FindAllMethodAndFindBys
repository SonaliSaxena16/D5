FindAll() annotation is used when we want to locate a particular Web Element with more than 1 type of 
locator.

@FindAll annotation is used to locate a WebElement or list of WebElements with more than one selector.
While using @FindAll, it should be noted that either of the Selectors used should be matching to locate
the respective WebElement(s).
It is an “OR” condition between all the selectors given in the annotation. @FindAll uses multiple
@FindBy annotation statements in the parameter to locate the WebElements.
Using @FindAll, we can provide two or more different selectors for a WebElement, so in case the first
locator doesn’t work, it will check the second. 

Ex - 

public WebElement searchBox();
@FindAll(
	@FindBy(css= "id-12:45er")
		@FindBy(id= "id-12:1212")

		
FindBys() annotation is @FindBys annotation is used to locate a WebElement or list of WebElements with
more than one selector. The condition in using @FindBys is that all of the selectors given in the
@FindBys should match the respective WebElement(s) criteria.
It is an “AND” condition between all the selectors given in the annotation. This is helpful in cases
where we don’t have a unique locator for the WebElement that we need to interact with on the web page.

Ex - 

public WebElement txtBox();
@FindBys(
	@FindBy(css= "id-12:45er") // Main Div.
		@FindBy(id= "id-12:1212") // This is the exact row I was looking for.
