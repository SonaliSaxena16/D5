What is Cross Browser Testing ?
Selenium supports Cross Browser Testing. By using browser-specific drivers (like ChromeDriver for
Chrome or GeckoDriver for Firefox), Selenium WebDriver interacts directly with each browser, 
simulating real user actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating between pages.

How is Cross Browser Testing achived in Selenium using TestNG ?
Using @Parameters, in config file I can define my multiple browsers in the XML file I can mention
@Paramaters name="browser" value="chrome"
