Once you have specified all the actions you want to perform, you can call the build method to build the
Actions object. 

Perform is used to execute the actions that were built using the build method. Once you call to perform,
Selenium will execute the actions in the order that they were specified.

Que1 Can we use perform without build?
Ans Yes, without calling the build() method, you could call the perform() method for performing the
sequence of actions.

Actions act = new Actions(driver);
act.moveToElement().click().perform();
