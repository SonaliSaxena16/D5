JavaScriptExecutor is an interface provided by Selenium that helps in executing JavaScript commands. 
This interface provides methods to run JavaScript on the selected window or the current web page.

 JavaScriptExecutor can be used to implement java script methods and with sendKeys() method as well.
 
 JavaScriptExecutor js = (JavaScriptExecutor)driver; // We've upcasted Web driver into java script executor(I). As Interface cannot be instantiated.
 
  // Try these 3 on google.com - inspect - console - write - alert("msg")
  
 js.executeScript("alert('Welcome')");
 js.executeScript("prompt('Hey, your name please')"); // Prompt would ask you with textbox to enter your answer
 js.executeScript("confirm('Are you sure?')");
 
 // If textbox is visibe and enable then only we can do sendkeys in DOM else it'll fail but with js if textbox is 
 Disabled still we can do force sendKeys that's the power of js.
 
 JavaScriptExecutor js = (JavaScriptExecutor)driver; // We've upcasted Web driver into java script executor(I). As Interface cannot be instantiated.
 
 WebElement email = driver.findElement(By.id("user_email"));
 
 js.executeScript("arguments[0].value='abc@gmail.com'", email);
 
 WebElement loginBtn = driver.findElement(By.id("Login"));
  
 js.executeScript("arguments[0].click()", loginBtn);
