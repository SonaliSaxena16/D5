(xpath="//h2[text()='Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.']")

(xpath="//input[@data-testid='royal-email']")

(xpath="//*[contains(@name,'email')]")

(xpath="//*[contains(text(),'Create a Page')]")

What are AXIS Methos ? 

Axis are - when we try to locate Target Element with the help of Current Element. This relationship between target & current element is called Axis. 
Ex - Textbox Label=Email
Below is the textbox to enter your email. Now to uniquely locate email textbox suppose I don't have any unique attribute. So I would be taking help of Xpath Axis where I would be locating the Current Element first which Email
then with this Label email I would be traversing to locate my target element which email textbox.

Now we've many xpath axes methods but there are main 5 based on Relationship -
Ancestor
Parent
Sibling
Child
Descendant
Extra Methods - following / preceding 

							A
							|
							B
							|
							C
							|
						W - ME - X
							|
						D		E	
						|		|
						F		G,H,I
						
Explanation :
For ME -> C is the Parent
For ME -> C,B,A all works as a GrandParent means - Ancestor
For ME -> D,E are Child
D,E are Sibling with each other
For ME -> D,E,F,G,H,I all are GrandChildren means Descendant

Now here are the detailed xpath methods -
Always start thing from ME.

My Ancestor = ancestor[It would return C,B,A] /  ancestor-or-self[It would return ME,C,B,A] Ex - 
Parent = parent[It would return C]
Sibling = preceding-sibling for ME is W /  following-sibling for H is X.
Child = child[It would return D,E]
Descendant = descendant[It would return D,E,F,G,H,I] / descendant-or-self[It would return ME,D,E,F,G,H,I]
						
Syntax o use any axes : (xpath)/axes::tagName[indexing]

Ex - goto amazon - search mobiles under 20000 - scroll and locate the 4th mobile.
