The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK.

There are three types of Alert in Selenium, described as follows:

Simple Alert - This alert is used to notify a simple warning message with an ‘OK’ button. 
Prompt Alert - This alert will ask the user to input the required information to complete the task.
Confirmation Alert - This alert is basically used for the confirmation of some tasks. For Example: Do you wish to continue a particular task? Yes or No?

First we need to switch to alert

 alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
 
 Alert have 4 methods()-
 1. driver.switchTo().alert().getText();
 2. driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss();
 3. driver.switchTo().alert().accept();
 4. driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys("Text");
