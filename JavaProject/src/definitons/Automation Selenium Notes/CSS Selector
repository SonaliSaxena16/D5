What is CSS Selector ?

Css allows only one directional flow which means the traversal is from parent to child only.
CSS selector syntax is more beginner-friendly, as well as easier to maintain. Also, these are 
faster than XPath.

There are five types of CSS Selectors available, those are:
1) Simple Selectors
2) Combinator selectors
3) Pseudo-class selectors
4) Pseudo-elements selectors
5) Attribute selectors

-- Simple Selectors --
Used for finding the elements based on simple attributes (id and class)

-- Combinator selectors --
Used for defining the relationship between elements in the HTML webpage.

-- Pseudo-class selectors --
Used for finding the elements based on element locations/positions/indexes

-- Pseudo-elements selectors --
Used for selecting an element then apply a style to part of that element.

-- Attribute selectors --
Used for finding the elements based on attributes and attribute values

There are four patterns available in CSS SIMPLE Selectors.
1) CSS Element Selector - We use TasgName here to locate element using CSS - To use TagName goto - DevTools - ctrl+f - directly mention tagname ex - button ; but this method isn't reliable as using button tagname would give multiple results.
2) CSS ID Selector - We use id of the element here to locate element using CSS - To use id use #valueOfTheId. Ex - DevTools - ctrl+f - #firstName. driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#name"))
3) CSS Class Selector - We use class of the element here to locate element using CSS - To use class use .valueOfTheId. Ex - DevTools - ctrl+f - .gender. driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".name"))
4) CSS Universal Selector - It'll selects all the web elements present in the web page. driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("*")).size();

CSS Element Selector:- This finds the elements in the HTML page based on the element tagname.

CSS ID Selector:- This finds the elements in the HTML page based on the element's id attribute value.

CSS Class Selector:- This finds the elements in the HTML page based on the element's class attribute value.

CSS Universal Selector:- The universal selector (*) finds all HTML elements on the page.
