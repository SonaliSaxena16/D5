To capture screenshots in Selenium, one has to utilize the method TakesScreenshot(). 
This notifies WebDriver that it should take a screenshot in Selenium and store it.

Step 1 – Convert web driver object to TakeScreenshot(I)

TakesScreenshot ts =(TakesScreenshot)driver; // We've upcasted Web driver into TakesScreenshot(I). As Interface cannot be instantiated.

Step 2 – Call getScreenshotAs method to create image file

File ss = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

Step 3 - Now I want to see that Screenshot visually so I'll use copy() of FILE class from com.google.commom.io.

Files.copy(ss , new File("path of the screenshot folder"));
