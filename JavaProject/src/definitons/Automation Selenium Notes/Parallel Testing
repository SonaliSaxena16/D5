Ans12 Parallel testing is a testing methodology where multiple test cases are executed at the same time.
It allows the execution of the same tests simultaneously in multiple environments(Browsers, OS, Servers).
The goal of parallel testing is to reduce time and resource constraints.

Que13 How to do parallel testing ?
Ans13 Parallel execution can be achieved either with @Data Provider Or Using defining cretain properties in Xml file.
Either mention this in your xml file <suite name="Parallel_Testing" parallel="methods" thread-count="2">.
Or create a class add methods later - Right Click - COnvert to testNG class - There in the class creation window set the above properties.
Mainly 2 aspects we need to focus in nParalle testing -
1. Set your XML file
2. In your test.java class inside your test script call this - Thread.currentThread().getId // This method shows the latest thread running and gives its id in console.
Add Thread.currentThread().getId in all of your test scripts
