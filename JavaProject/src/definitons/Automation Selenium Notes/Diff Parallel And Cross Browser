Difference in parallel testing and cross browser testing ?

While both terms are often used together in software testing, "parallel testing" refers to the
practice of running multiple tests simultaneously across different environments to speed up the
testing process, while "cross browser testing" specifically focuses on checking how an application 
behaves and functions across different web browsers to ensure compatibility and consistency across 
platforms; essentially, parallel testing can be used to perform cross browser testing faster by 
running tests on multiple browsers concurrently.
