TestNG provides the @Listeners annotation which listens to every event that occurs in a selenium code.
Listeners are activated either before the test or after the test case. It is an interface that modifies
the TestNG behavior. For example, when you are running a test case either through selenium or appium
and suddenly a test case fails. We need a screenshot of the test case that has been failed, to achieve 
such scenario, TestNG provides a mechanism, i.e., Listeners. When the test case failure occurs, then it
is redirected to the new block written for the screenshot.

Listeners are implemented by the ITestListener interface. An ITestListener interface has the following
methods:
onTestStart(): An onTestStart() is invoked only when any test method gets started.

onTestSuccess(): An onTestSuccess() method is executed on the success of a test method.

onTestFailure(): An onTestFailure() method is invoked when test method fails.

onTestSkipped(): An onTestSkipped() run only when any test method has been skipped.

onTestFailedButWithinSuccessPercentage(): This method is invoked each time when the test method fails but within success percentage.

onStart(): When suite execution starts this method is invoked.

onFinish(): An onFinish() is invoked when suite execution finishes.

How to implement listeners ?
Ans 1. create a class name as MyTestLinstener implements ITestListener.
2. Then goto the test class where you've written @Test scripts mention @Listeners import it from the class which you've just created for Listeners (MyTestListener.class)
3. Then in xlm file start Listeners tag - 
<listeners>
<listeners class name= "packageName.yourListenersClassName"> ex below -
<listeners class name= "nic.ehospital.qa.base.MyTestListeners"> 
</listeners>

How to run failed test cases in testng ?
There are two ways to perform a failed test in TestNG:

1. Using the testng-failed.xml file - Test output folder - testng-failed.xml - Right click - run.
2. Using the IRetryAnalyzer interface.
